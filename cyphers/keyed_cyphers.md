## One Time Pad

OTP is usually random data (called a key) that is XORed with your plain text. It is impossible to brute force as the random string has no pattern. 
If mentioned in a geocache, it's more likely to be a Running Key Cypher

## Running Key

This cypher works in a similar way, but the random key for the data is not random at all, but something like a paragraph of text that is as long as or longer than the encrypted text. 

## Vigenère

[Tool](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) including some options for brute forcing if you know some information

Another simplification, The key for Vigenère is shorter and repeated if needed.
