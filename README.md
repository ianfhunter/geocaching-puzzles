# Overview

A centralized place for me to gather geocaching puzzle solving information. Hosting it on git allows it to be extended by anyone on the internet, so if you want to contribute, go right ahead.

# Finding the shape of the puzzle

This is a crucial first step to identifying how to solve a puzzle.

**15 missing values**
> N xx° xx.xxx W xxx° xx.xxx

This can be a very useful format because its unlikely the major values (e.g. 54°, 006°) will be different to the clue coordinates. Thus you can verify some of your answers for the numbers.
 
**10 missing values**
> N 54° xx.xxx W 006° xx.xxx

Generally, but not always, the "ground zero" of a cache is within 2 miles or so.
so we can be reasonably certain that the base coordinates can be reused.

**6 missing values**
> N 54° 12.xxx W 006° 12.xxx
